      <description>This is the post regarding the Python-R305 package.
R305 is a very common finger print sensor. It is quite cheap, has a storage capacity of 250 fingerprints.
I came across this module about one and a half year ago. I had to use it in a small project with Raspberry-Pi. At that time I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a python API that covers all of the functionality provided by the module.</description>

      <description>LTC6802 The LTC6802 is a complete battery monitoring IC that includes a 12-bit ADC, a precision voltage reference, a high voltage input multiplexer and a serial interface. Each LTC6802-2 can measure up to 12 series connected bat-tery cells with an input common mode voltage up to 60V.
LTC6802 is a great option if you want to build battry monitoring system with more accuracy. This IC operates on SPI protocol.</description>

      <description>If you are using raspberry pi for the first time; then this post might be helpful to setup the device.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll cover
 installing raspbian/ubuntu on the sd card for raspberry pi. configuring ssh. configuring wifi to connect to the network automatically.  Installing Raspbian/Ubuntu on the SD card First of all download the image of the os you want to install on the SD card from raspberrypi.</description>

      <description>Plotcat Hello all, I&amp;rsquo;m writing once again after almost six months. As the title of this post suggests I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about plotting the live input data from a serial device using python. This data can be any input data that is comming through a serial port from any device such as a microcontroller, Arduino, any usart based wireless module such as HC-05 or HM-10 etc.
The reason I am writing this post is during past three or four months I did few small projects for Slightgen.</description>

      <description>On 6-Feb-2016 it was third Fedora meetup at pune at the same venue as earlier meetups &amp;ldquo;K 104, Jasminium, Magarpatta City Pune&amp;rdquo;. Event host was Kushal Das.
For this meetup the ajenda was &amp;ldquo;Debugging bugs in different applications written in C/Python in Fedora&amp;rdquo;. But after last meetup Amol and me had discussed about writing a tool like &amp;ldquo;Ip messenger&amp;rdquo; (our purpose was for file transfer) for linux which will be a nautilus plugin; so we decided that in this meetup we will do it.</description>

      <description>Python What is Python? Python is probably one of the few programming languages which is both simple and powerful.
It is a general purpose Language.
Features of Python:
Simple:
Python is a simple and minimalistic language. Reading a good Python code feels almost like reading English. It allows you to concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than the language itself.
Free and Open Source:
Python is an example of a FLOSS (Free/Libr√© and Open Source Software).</description>
