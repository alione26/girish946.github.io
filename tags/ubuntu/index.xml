      <description>On 6-Feb-2016 it was third Fedora meetup at pune at the same venue as earlier meetups &amp;ldquo;K 104, Jasminium, Magarpatta City Pune&amp;rdquo;. Event host was Kushal Das.
For this meetup the ajenda was &amp;ldquo;Debugging bugs in different applications written in C/Python in Fedora&amp;rdquo;. But after last meetup Amol and me had discussed about writing a tool like &amp;ldquo;Ip messenger&amp;rdquo; (our purpose was for file transfer) for linux which will be a nautilus plugin; so we decided that in this meetup we will do it.</description>
